Welcome to the Event Probability Simulator! This application allows you to simulate various events and calculate their probabilities using different probability models.

## Features

- **Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- **Multiple Probability simulations**: Choose from different probability simuations such as Permutations, Combinations, Bayes' Theorem, Number of Trials Simulation, and more.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust parameters like the number of trials, event outcomes, and success criteria.

## Getting Started
